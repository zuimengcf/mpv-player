- **Media Library View** — browse your full video collection outside the file tree
- **Shorts Mode** — overhauled vertical video player with directory source filters, session Free Mode, Clean UI Mode, and reactive MPV observers

### ⚙️ Engine & Customization

- **HDR-to-SDR Tone Mapping** — high-quality tone mapping via `hdr-toys` shader pipeline
- **Smart Orientation** — force landscape/portrait per video, stored as a preference

### ⚡ Performance
